                <p>
                    A strange virus has spread across the world and infected everything from the wildlife to you. 
                    But this curse gives you a strange gift - when you die, you are brought back to life by the virus who needs its host.
                    The people of the world needs your help to defeat this virus once and for all - but what will that do to you?

                <h2>Our experience</h2>
                <p>
                    All our team members learned something from this project and this course, different things depending on who you ask.
                    Kanban and teamwork, git, CI/CD, libgdx, maven and mocking are just some topic to name a few.
                    <br><br>
                    The project was fun and instructive, but also a little exhausting at times. 
                    Libgdx was also not that easy to learn, very few good resources and examples to learn the API.
